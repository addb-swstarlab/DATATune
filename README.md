# DATATune
SAC 2025 UnderReview ... 😵‍💫

We propose DATATune as a novel approach that differs from trditional database parameter tuning methods.  
To minimize the time required for data generation, DATATune incorporates an **augmentation method for small datasets**. Moreover, it **creates a latent space** by reducing database parameter information and **optimizing all parameters**. Furthermore, by injecting external metric information in the latent space yield precise tuning results by **directly incorporating information from the target workload**.  
Our results show that when comparing the performance improvements of DATATune and the baseline models across four different workloads on MySQL and RocksDB, we observed maximum performance improvements of **1332% for RocksDB** and up to **11.82% in throughput and 46.01% in latency for MySQL**.
